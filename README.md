How the System Works Overall
This Hospital Management System is designed to integrate all hospital operations into a single platform, providing better patient services and enhancing efficiency. Below is an explanation of its main functionalities:

1. User Registration and Login
Hospital staff and patients have separate registration options:

Hospital staff: Register with details based on their roles (doctors, pharmacy staff, or administrators).
Patients: Provide basic information such as name, age, contact number, and email.
Every user is assigned role-based access:

Admin: Full access to manage the entire system.
Doctor: Limited access to view and update patient-related information.
Pharmacy staff: Access to prescriptions and inventory.
Patient: Access to appointments and prescribed medications.
2. Patient Record Management
The system stores all patient information in a centralized, secure database.
When a patient visits the hospital, doctors can easily access:
Basic information: Name, age, and contact details.
Medical history: Previous diagnoses, prescribed medications, and test results.
Recent updates: Current prescriptions or scheduled appointments.
This ensures that patients do not have to repeatedly explain their medical history.

3. Appointment Scheduling
Patients can book appointments with doctors through a user-friendly interface.
Doctors and hospital management can monitor the appointment schedule electronically, preventing:
Overlapping appointments.
Wasted time or inconvenience to patients.
4. Prescription Management
Doctors write prescriptions in the system, and they immediately become available:
In the pharmacy: The pharmacy staff can check whether the prescribed drugs are in stock or need to be restocked.
For the patient: Prescriptions can be printed or sent via email.
5. Inventory and Billing Management
Pharmacy Inventory:

The system tracks all medical supplies and drugs in stock.
It sends notifications when supplies are low, allowing hospital management to restock in time.
Billing:

When a patient is prescribed medication or uses any hospital services, the system generates an invoice automatically.
Financial staff can access reports on payments, reducing errors in billing.
6. Reporting and Analytics
Admin users can generate reports on hospital performance, including:
The number of patients treated daily or monthly.
Frequently used medications.
Departmental efficiency.
These reports help the hospital make informed decisions, such as hiring more staff or purchasing new equipment.

7. Data Security
The system uses authentication and encryption to protect patient information:
Unauthorized users cannot access sensitive patient data.
All actions performed within the system are securely logged (audit logs).
8. Department Integration
Different departments (doctors, pharmacy, lab, and administration) work seamlessly together because the system integrates all information.
Communication between departments is reliable and efficient, with no delays in information flow.
9. Scalability
The system can adapt to the hospitalâ€™s size:
It works well for small clinics with basic needs.
It can expand to large multi-specialty hospitals with multiple departments.
How Everything Works Together:
Patient: Starts with an appointment booking and enters their details into the system.
Doctor: Reviews the patient's data, examines them, and prescribes medication if necessary.
Pharmacy: Processes prescriptions, dispenses medication, or notifies admin to restock supplies.
Admin: Accesses reports and oversees all operations.
